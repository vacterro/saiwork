# Winget release automation

SaiWork publishes Winget updates from the stable GitHub release pipeline. `.github/workflows/reusable-release.yml` now calls `.github/workflows/update-winget.yml` after the release assets finish uploading.

## Trigger

- Runs as a reusable workflow from the stable release pipeline, after `build-and-upload` completes.
- Resolves the target release by tag through the GitHub API, then exits early for draft or prerelease releases.
- Can also be rerun manually with `workflow_dispatch` by supplying the stable release tag (and optionally the numeric release id).
- This avoids the old `release.published` trap where a release created by GitHub Actions with the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` does not fan out into a second workflow run.
- Waits for the expected stable Windows Tauri asset because the release record can exist before all assets finish uploading.

## Required configuration

### Repository secret

- `WINGET_GITHUB_TOKEN`: Classic GitHub PAT with `public_repo` scope.
  - The token owner must own the fork that submits to `microsoft/winget-pkgs`.
  - Komac-based submission cannot open the PR with a fine-grained token today.

### Repository variables

- `WINGET_PACKAGE_IDENTIFIER` (default fallback in workflow: `NeuralNomadsAI.SaiWork`)
- `WINGET_FORK_OWNER` (default fallback in workflow: `pascalandr`)
- `WINGET_WINDOWS_ASSET_NAME_TEMPLATE` (default fallback in workflow: `SaiWork-Tauri-windows-x64-{version}.zip`)
- `WINGET_ASSET_WAIT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (optional, default fallback: `900`)
- `WINGET_ASSET_POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS` (optional, default fallback: `15`)

`{version}` is replaced from the release tag after trimming a leading `v`.

## Runtime flow

1. Resolve the target release by tag through the GitHub API, then derive the package version from the resolved release tag.
2. Poll the release API until exactly one uploaded asset matches the configured Windows Tauri asset template.
3. Download the matched asset once and compute a SHA-256 for logging and verification.
4. Verify the PAT owner matches `WINGET_FORK_OWNER` and that `${WINGET_FORK_OWNER}/winget-pkgs` is a fork of `microsoft/winget-pkgs`.
5. Invoke `vedantmgoyal9/winget-releaser@v2`, which uses Komac under the hood to update the existing `NeuralNomadsAI.SaiWork` manifest and open the PR.

## Notes

- The workflow does not depend on a persistent local `winget-pkgs` clone.
- The current package in `winget-pkgs` uses the release ZIP with a nested NSIS installer, so the workflow targets the stable `SaiWork-Tauri-windows-x64-{version}.zip` asset.
- If a maintainer publishes a release outside the standard release workflow, they should manually run `Update Winget` for that stable tag.
