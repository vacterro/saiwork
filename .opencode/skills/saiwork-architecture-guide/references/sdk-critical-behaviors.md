# SDK Critical Behaviors

## Upstream OpenCode Behaviors

The following behaviors are implemented in the upstream OpenCode SDK/server, not in the SaiWork repository. They affect how SaiWork must interact with the SDK.

## Critical Behaviors Table

| Behavior | Detail | Impact | Verification |
|----------|--------|--------|--------------|
| `ignored: true` on assistant parts | Backend only checks for user parts | Assistant parts still sent to AI model | Observe via SSE behavior; not verifiable locally |
| Part delete | Message must retain ≥1 part | Delete entire message if last part | `packages/ui/src/stores/session-actions.ts` |
| Metadata on assistant parts | Passed as `providerMetadata` to ai SDK | Flat objects cause fatal schema violations | Avoid setting metadata on assistant parts |
| Session revert | Only restores files to Git snapshot | Not an undo mechanism for messages | Test via `client.session.revert()` |
| Empty messages | Backend rejects `parts: []` | Check part count before delete | `packages/ui/src/stores/session-actions.ts` |

## Schema Violation Details

### Assistant Part Metadata (Fatal)

**Behavior:** Assistant text part `metadata` is passed as `providerMetadata` to the underlying AI SDK.

**Expected format:**
```typescript
providerMetadata?: Record<string, Record<string, JsonValue>>
```

**Violation examples:**
```typescript
// ❌ WRONG: Flat object
metadata: { compacted: true }

// ❌ WRONG: Missing provider name wrapper
metadata: { key: "value" }

// ✅ CORRECT: Nested by provider
metadata: { openai: { key: "value" } }
```

**Fix:** Do not store metadata on assistant text parts. Use client-side registry instead:
```typescript
// ✅ Use client-side registry
// packages/ui/src/stores/session-compaction.ts
const compactedParts = new Set<string>() // part IDs
```

### Empty Messages After Part Deletion

**Root Cause:** Backend validates messages have ≥1 part

**Fix:** Check remaining part count before deleting last part
```typescript
// packages/ui/src/stores/session-actions.ts
if (record.partIds.length <= 1) {
  // Delete entire message instead
  await deleteMessage(sessionID, messageID)
} else {
  await deleteMessagePart(sessionID, messageID, partID)
}
```

## `ignored` Flag Asymmetry

| Part Type | `ignored: true` Effect | Notes |
|-----------|------------------------|-------|
| User text | ✅ Excluded from AI model context | Safe to use |
| Assistant text | ❌ No effect — still sent to model | Do not rely on this |
| Tool | ❌ No `ignored` field exists | N/A |
| Reasoning | ❌ No `ignored` field exists | N/A |

**Implication:** Cannot "soft delete" assistant parts. Must delete or use client-side registry.

## Decision Matrix: Context Modification

| Goal | Strategy | SDK Support | Safe? |
|------|----------|-------------|-------|
| Update assistant text | `Part.update()` (if available) | ✅ | ✅ Yes (no metadata) |
| Update user text | `Part.update()` (if available) | ✅ | ✅ Yes |
| Hide user part from AI | `ignored: true` | ✅ | ✅ Yes |
| Hide assistant part from AI | `ignored: true` | ⚠️ No effect | ❌ No effect |
| Delete part | `client.part.delete()` | ✅ | ✅ Yes (check message parts) |
| Delete message | Raw DELETE via client | ✅ | ✅ Yes (irreversible) |
| Undo message deletion | Client-side restore | ⚠️ Manual | ⚠️ Must recreate |
| Revert code changes | `client.session.revert()` | ✅ | ✅ Only affects files |
| Store UI state | Client-side registry | N/A | ✅ localStorage/Set |

## Race Conditions

### Optimistic Updates

**Symptom:** UI state desync after rapid operations

**Cause:** `removeMessagePartV2()` and `removeMessageV2()` called optimistically before server confirmation

**Mitigation:** SSE events eventually converge state. Do not rely on optimistic state for subsequent operations.

### SSE Disconnection

**Symptom:** Missed events during reconnection

**Mitigation:** `serverEvents` reconnection triggers sync handlers (e.g., `syncPendingPermissions()`) to reconcile state.

## Recommendations

1. **Never store flat metadata on assistant text parts.** Always use client-side registries for UI state.
2. **Prefer user messages for metadata-heavy operations.** User text parts don't pass metadata to ai SDK.
3. **Implement client-side undo for destructive operations.** The SDK has no native message-level undo.
4. **Validate part payloads before sending.** Always spread existing part and override only specific fields.
5. **Handle `ignored` carefully.** It only works for user text parts. Don't rely on it for assistant parts.
