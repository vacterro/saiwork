// On mobile, backgrounding the app suspends JS execution and the SSE
// connection eventually times out (commonly ~45s). Events that would have
// arrived while suspended -- a tool call finishing, a message completing --
// are lost, and the UI can appear stuck as "running" even though the work
// actually finished on the server.
//
// The reliable signal that this happened is the SSE transport's
// disconnected -> connected transition, not visibilitychange itself: a brief
// tab switch where the connection stays alive should NOT force a reload
// (that was tried first and it cleared in-flight "sending" state, making it
// look like the AI never responded -- see git history on this hook).
// Only once we know events were actually missed do we re-fetch session
// status and force-reload messages to surface whatever completed while
// disconnected.
