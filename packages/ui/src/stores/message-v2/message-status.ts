/**
 * Single source of truth for deriving a message's lifecycle status from its
 * server-side info, shared by the live SSE path (session-events) and the REST
 * snapshot path (session-api) so a force-reload can never disagree with the
 * streaming derivation.
 *
 * Follows the OpenCode SDK contract (1.17.x):
 *   - Only assistant messages carry `error` and a completion timestamp.
 *   - Assistant completion is `time.completed` (NOT `time.end`, which is a
 *     part-level field, not message completion).
 *   - User messages expose only `time.created` and are complete once
 *     persisted — they have no pending/streaming server state.
