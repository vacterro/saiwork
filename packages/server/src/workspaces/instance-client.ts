/**
 * Creates an OpenCode SDK client for direct loopback communication with a
 * running workspace instance.
 *
 * Routes and body shapes come from the auto-generated SDK contract
 * (`@opencode-ai/sdk`), eliminating handwritten URL construction that can
 * drift between SDK versions. Other server modules that need to call the
 * OpenCode instance directly should use this factory rather than building
 * `http://127.0.0.1:{port}/...` URLs by hand.
 *
 * Requests carry a 10-second timeout (configurable via `timeoutMs`) —
 * loopback calls should be near-instant; a hang indicates a stuck instance.
 *
 * The client is cheap to create (object only, no connection); create one per
 * call or cache per instance as needed. Returns `null` when the instance has
 * no open port yet.
